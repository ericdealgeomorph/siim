# Changelog

Short release notes. Public behavior and configuration are documented in the
guides and API reference under `docs/`.

## 0.9.1 — August 2026 (current)

The standalone migration: siim's 2D model no longer requires the frozen
fastscape/xsimlab/fastscapelib-fortran stack.

**Packaging (the headline)**
- The 2D model (`siim.siim2d`, `siim.escarpment`) is now **pip-installable
  standalone**: `pip install siim` runs everything on numpy/scipy/numba/
  matplotlib/tqdm/xarray/pandas (numpy 2 supported; `xarray` and `pandas` are
  direct, unpinned core dependencies). No conda required for default use.
- `siim.fastscape` is demoted to the **optional adapter**
  (`pip install siim[fastscape]`); importing it without Fastscape raises a
  directed error, while missing conda-only runtime backends are reported when
  the corresponding stock process is used. fastscapelib-fortran remains conda-only —
  `environment.yml` is retitled the fastscape-adapter / legacy env and keeps
  its numpy<2 / xarray<2026.5 / zarr<3 quarantine (which no longer constrains
  a default install). A `dev-parity` extra ships for the future fastscapelib
  parity probe (workflow_dispatch-only CI stub pre-1.0). The published
  `environment.yml` is a lean `siim-adapter` environment rather than the full
  paper/notebook development environment.
- Importing the optional adapter no longer monkey-patches private xarray
  internals or installs a process-wide warning filter. SIIM-owned xsimlab
  compatibility warnings are suppressed only around the calls that emit them.
- The release exporter now requires a committed, clean source snapshot and a
  synchronized public target. Its dry run performs the same artifact build,
  archive inspection, clean-environment install, smoke tests, and public-tree
  diff as publication, without changing either working tree.

**Numerics owned in-house (defaults flipped at 0.9.1)**
- Time loop: an in-house framework-free driver (`siim._core.driver`) replaces
  xsimlab orchestration (bit-for-bit identical `ds_out` on the same backend;
  `driver='xsimlab'` remains as the adapter-env escape hatch).
- Flow routing: in-house numba D8 fill-then-route (+ the already-in-house
  D-inf) replaces the fortran SFR. ⚠ **Behavioral change:** routing
  tie-break/depression paths differ from fortran by construction, and siim's
  2D landscapes are multistable under them — same-seed mode-B/C runs
  self-organise equivalent-but-different drainage networks (~100–170 m rms
  apart at identical attractor statistics). Gated behaviorally
  (receiver parity vs frozen raw fortran refs, analytical oracle, and attractor
  statistics). Compare attractors, not
  snapshots, against pre-0.9.1 runs.
- Flexure: in-house scipy.fft plate solve. ⚠ Fixes the fortran `pihy`
  anisotropy bug — on `dx != dy` grids results differ from fortran **by
  design** (validated against the closed-form Kelvin point-load solution);
  the k=0 (domain-mean) mode is zeroed, matching fortran's far-field-neutral
  DST semantics.
- Hillslope diffusion: in-house numba ADI, byte-identical to `fs.diffusion`
  for siim's uniform diffusivity. Its Thomas solver is independently expressed
  from the standard tridiagonal row recurrence.
- The retired `'fortran'` options of `router_backend`/`numerics_backend` now
  raise directed errors; the params survive as the (public-contract) backend
  plug points.

**API changes (pre-release, no deprecation cycle)**
- Default `boundary_status` is now the explicit
  `['fixed_value','fixed_value','looped','looped']`, and `'core'` means plain
  non-periodic interior for **every** router (previously fortran-SFR silently
  treated top/bottom `'core'` as y-cyclic while D-inf did not — the
  split-brain is gone; ratified OQ-1(b)).
- `run(hooks=...)` is dropped on the standalone driver (raises a directed
  error); xsimlab RuntimeHooks remain available via `driver='xsimlab'`.
- `nt_out` is validated to `1 <= nt_out <= nt` (previously `nt_out > nt`
  silently produced NaN frames under xsimlab).
- An explicit analytical `lam` override now consistently sets
  `kappa_c = 1/(1-lam)` in both `GeneralProfile` and `RegimeMap`; the default
  exponent-derived closure is unchanged.
- An explicit `mu` with an exact power or Coulomb numerical law is retained for
  the analytical/reporting interpretation but now warns that the exact kernel
  uses its law-derived exponent. The effective-exponent law continues to use
  the override numerically.
- Saved-run pickles now carry an explicit format/schema version, producing SIIM
  version, concrete model identity, the original parameter dictionary, and the
  xarray Dataset. Unversioned saves are rejected with a directed error rather
  than silently interpreted under current defaults.
- The standalone and adapter drivers now consume one shared output schema, and
  construction of the numerical law record is keyword-only to make its
  cross-module parameter contract resistant to accidental reordering.

**Verification (per stage, recorded in the plan)**
- Extraction + driver: bit-for-bit against the frozen reference battery and
  xsimlab at every output frame. Flexure: Kelvin oracle relRMS ~2e-5 (square)
  / 1.5e-4 (anisotropic). Diffusion: byte-identical twin. Router: 961/961
  byte-exact receivers on tie-free surfaces, exact fixed-point
  router-invariance, attractor means within 3.1%. The reference battery is
  re-frozen from the standalone defaults and remains the standing
  bit-for-bit determinism tripwire (per-platform); the raw fortran router
  refs remain immutable parity baselines.

## 0.9.0 — July 2026

The pre-release consolidation: everything below is on `main`, suite 376,
docs `-W` green, dev-CI green. v1.0 is reserved for the public release.

**Physics & boundary conditions**
- Base-level BC redesign (mode B): water/rock separation with a time-dependent
  Dirichlet water datum `bl(t)`; true-state outputs everywhere (see
  `docs/guides/outputs_and_io.md`).
- Ice borders are OUTFLOW boundaries: zero-gradient thickness (dominant donor
  in 2D) with the bed evolved by the implicit closed-form border budget on the
  arrival slope — dt-robust at any dt, bounded at the flotation draft.
- Waterline-flotation gate as an effective-pressure ramp
  (`flotation_gate`/`flotation_ramp`, γ = 0.1 default), interior + border.
- Channel-floor datum `hc/H̄ = 1.5` implemented across the numerical models and
  the analytical bed reconstructions (see `docs/guides/concepts.md`).

**Mode C (the flagship default: mode B + sub-grid width carving)**
- Sub-grid glacier-width carving via exact power-diagram attribution
  (see `docs/guides/configuring_a_run.md`); `widening_rate` default 3.0.
- Mode-C standard: `trunk_surface=True`, `routing_relax=0.5` by default
  (anti-flicker EMA); the flux-consolidation
  machinery removed.
- D-inf routing rebuilt on the eps-filled surface (fill-based redesign) plus
  D-inf mode B.

**Performance**
- `parallel_erode` (default ON): level-scheduled parallel mode-B erosion,
  bit-for-bit with the serial eroder — coulomb steps −43% (SFR) / −32% (D-inf)
  at 201×201.
- D-inf facet scan row-parallelized; allocation-free multi-receiver Newton.
  D-inf mode-C steps −19% (power) / −10% (coulomb) on top of the above.

**Infrastructure**
- Pre-1.0 code audit complete (91 findings adjudicated).
- Sphinx docs site (Furo + MyST-NB), `-W` clean; RTD config at the root.
- Frugal dev-CI (cached micromamba: suite + docs build per PR/push).
- Packaging: conda-only for the 2D stack (`environment.yml` is the contract,
  with the numpy<2 / zarr<3 / xarray-freeze quarantine around the unmaintained
  xsimlab); the lightweight core (1D + analytical) declares pip deps.

## 0.5.0 and earlier — 2026 (unreleased development)

Internal development: the 1D profile model, the 2D fastscape/xsimlab model,
the analytical package (steady-state profiles, closure solver, regime map),
the numpy/numba numerical core, and the law_code kernel rewrite.
